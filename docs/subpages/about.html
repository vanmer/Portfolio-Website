            <p>
              When you access a page on our website that has Vimeo embedded in
              it, a connection to Vimeo's servers in the USA is established. For

            <p>
              If you are logged into Vimeo while visiting one of our webpages
              containing a Vimeo video, Vimeo will associate information about
              your interaction with our site to your Vimeo account. If you wish
              to prevent this, you must either log out of Vimeo before visiting
