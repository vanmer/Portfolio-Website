          <p>
            I am Graphic Designer living and working in Leipzig.
            Born and raised in Munich, in 2016 I graduated from the 
            <a href="https://designschule-muenchen.de/bfs-kommunikationsdesign/" target="_blank" class="link">Designschule München</a>
            as a Staatlich geprüfter
            Kommunikationsdesigner.
            In the same year I moved to Leipzig to study Philosophy at the <a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/" target="_blank" class="link">Universität Leipzig</a>.
            Now I work  as a freelancing Graphic Designer, moving between the different media, web, print and video.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not working on some project, you will find me somewhere skateboarding, doing
            Ashtanga Yoga or juggling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, feel free to leave a message!

          <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
          <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the
            right</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being
              processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also
              Art. 15 GDPR);</li>
            <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
            <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if
              further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per
              Art. 18 GDPR;</li>
            <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted
              to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
            <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being
              processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such
            corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR.
            However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate
            effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
          <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's
              future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to
              data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>
          <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
          <p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its
            storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage
            obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>
